# Name Card QR Generator & Mini CRM

This folder contains the **Name Card QR Generator** and a small **client CRM/Scanner** that we built together.

## Quick start – Secure Scan Dashboard & User Management (Render)

- Secure dashboard URL (production): `https://namecard-17wq.onrender.com/secure-dashboard`
- Secure user management URL: `https://namecard-17wq.onrender.com/secure-users`
- The old `/dashboard` URL now redirects to the secure dashboard.
- Log in with a user stored in the Neon `users` table, for example:
  - CDC admin demo: `admin@example.com` (role `cdc_admin`)
  - Client admin demo: `laiwah76@gmail.com` (role `tenant_admin`)
  - Manager/employee demo: e.g. `manager@example.com` / `employee@example.com` (roles `manager`, `employee`)
- After admin login on `/secure-dashboard` you will see:
  - Tenant‑filtered scan table.
  - Stats (total scans, unique cards, last 7 days).
  - Filters (search, source, from/to dates).
- Role behavior on `/secure-dashboard`:
  - `cdc_admin`, `tenant_admin`, `manager`, `employee` can all sign in.
  - Only admin roles are allowed to view scans; others see an explanation message instead of data.
- Role behavior on `/secure-users`:
  - `cdc_admin` can manage users for **all tenants** (create client admins and staff, disable/activate any account) and see a small deletion audit log.
  - `tenant_admin` can manage **only their own tenant** staff (`manager`, `employee`): create, disable, activate.
  - `manager` and `employee` can open the page but it is read‑only (no create/disable/activate buttons).
  - Disabled accounts can no longer log in but still appear in the list with a `Disabled` status; admins can re‑activate them.

## 1. Main parts

- `index.html`
  - Employee **Name Card QR Generator** UI.
  - Generates a vCard QR code that phones can scan to add the contact.
  - New button under **Company**:
    - **"Export this company (CSV)"** – downloads employees of that company from the server database.

- `api/`
  - `save_card.php` – saves employee card data into a SQLite DB (`data/namecard.db`, table `cards`).
  - `get_card.php` – loads card data by `sessionId`.
  - `export_cards.php` – **new**: exports all cards for a given company as CSV.
    - URL: `api/export_cards.php?company=COMPANY_NAME`.
    - CSV columns: `Company, First Name, Last Name, Mobile, Office, Email, Address, Updated At`.

- `export.html` / `export.js`
  - Existing **image export** for the card.
  - Works fully in the browser (no PHP) – downloads a PNG image of the designed card.

- `clientScanner/`
  - **New mini CRM for clients, separate from employees.**
  - `scanner.html` – "Client Scanner (Beta)" UI:
    - Textarea to paste QR/vCard text.
    - Button **Parse from text** to fill fields from vCard.
    - Form to save client: first/last name, company, email, mobile, source/note.
  - `scanner.js` – logic to:
    - Parse vCard text (N, FN, TEL, EMAIL, ORG) and fill form.
    - POST client data as JSON to `clientScanner/api/add_client.php`.
  - `api/add_client.php` – saves a client into `data/crm.db`, table `clients`.
    - Fields: `first_name, last_name, company, email, mobile, source, created_at, updated_at`.
  - `clients.php` – lists clients from `data/crm.db`:
    - Table view with: ID, first/last, company, email, mobile, source, created at.
    - Buttons:
      - **Back to Client Scanner** (`scanner.html`).
      - **Export all clients (CSV)** → `clientScanner/api/export_clients.php`.
  - `api/export_clients.php` – exports **all clients** as CSV.
    - CSV columns: `ID, First Name, Last Name, Company, Email, Mobile, Source, Created At, Updated At`.

## 2. Databases

Both use **SQLite** in the `data` folder:

- `data/namecard.db`
  - Table `cards`:
    - `session_id` (PRIMARY KEY)
    - `first_name, last_name, mobile, office, company, email, address, updated_at`.

- `data/crm.db`
  - Table `clients`:
    - `id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT)
    - `first_name, last_name, company, email, mobile, source, created_at, updated_at`.

## 3. Running with PHP (important for CSV and CRM)

The PNG export (`export.html`) works on any static server, but **CSV export and CRM features require PHP**.

To test everything properly, serve this folder with a PHP‑enabled server (Apache/XAMPP, built‑in `php -S`, or another PHP host) and access it via `http://...`, **not** `file:///` or a pure static dev server.

### Minimal PHP server example (if available later)

From the `NameCard` folder:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then in the browser:

- Name Card QR Generator: `http://localhost:8000/index.html`
- Employee CSV export: use the **"Export this company (CSV)"** button.
- Client Scanner: `http://localhost:8000/clientScanner/scanner.html`
- Clients list: `http://localhost:8000/clientScanner/clients.php`

> Note: On your current machine you might need IT help or a portable PHP to run this command. The structure above is ready for when PHP is available.

## 4. Typical flows

### 4.1 Employee side (NameCard)

1. Open `index.html` via PHP server.
2. Fill form (First/Last/Mobile/Company at minimum).
3. Generate QR → employees share this QR with clients.
4. HR can export all employees of a company as CSV using:
   - Button under Company in the form, or
   - Direct URL: `api/export_cards.php?company=COMPANY_NAME`.

### 4.2 Client side (mini CRM)

1. Open `clientScanner/scanner.html` via PHP server.
2. Paste vCard text from a scanned QR (or fill manually).
3. Click **Parse from text** to fill fields.
4. Click **Save client to CRM** → stored in `crm.db`.
5. Open `clientScanner/clients.php` to:
   - See all saved clients.
   - Export them as CSV for CRM/HR systems.

## 5. Node/Express backend & secure dashboard (Neon + Render)

In addition to the PHP utilities above, there is a **Node/Express backend** that powers a multi‑tenant, secure scan dashboard deployed on Render.

- Backend entry: `backend/src/server.js`
- Database: Neon Postgres (`neondb`)
- Deployed base URL (Render): `https://namecard-17wq.onrender.com`

### 5.1 Key routes

- `GET /health` – simple health check.
- `POST /auth/login`
  - Body: `{ "email": "...", "password": "..." }`
  - Looks up the user in `users` table by **lower‑cased email**.
  - Compares the plain password with `password_hash` (temporary, no hashing yet).
  - On success returns `{ success, token, user }`.

- `GET /secure-dashboard`
  - Secure HTML page with:
    - Login form calling `/auth/login`.
    - Once logged in, calls `/api/secure-scans` with header `x-auth-token: <token>`.
    - Shows tenant‑filtered scans in a table.
    - Shows per‑tenant stats (total scans, unique cards, last 7 days).
    - Client‑side filters: text search, source, date range.
    - Special message for non‑admin users when access is forbidden.

- `GET /api/secure-scans`
  - Protected by `authMiddleware` and role check.
  - Only users with `role = 'tenant_admin'` can access.
  - Uses `req.user.id` to look up `tenant_id` in `users` table.
  - Returns only scans where `cards.tenant_id = user's tenant_id`.

- `GET /dashboard`
  - Now redirects to `/secure-dashboard` so users always land on the secure, authenticated view.

- `GET /dashboard/export`
  - CSV export of all scans from Postgres (still available as a direct link).

### 5.2 Tenants, users, and roles

Tables (simplified):

- `tenants`
  - `id, name, slug, ...`

- `users`
  - `id, tenant_id, email, password_hash, role, display_name, ...`
  - `role` is validated by a CHECK constraint, currently allowing:
    - `tenant_admin` – full access to secure dashboard and scans.
    - `tenant_user` – can log in but cannot view secure scans.

- `cards`
  - `id, tenant_id, first_name, last_name, company, position, email, mobile, ...`

- `scans`
  - `id, card_id, source, scan_meta, created_at, ...`

The secure scans endpoint joins `scans` with `cards` and filters by `cards.tenant_id`. Each user only sees scans for their own tenant.

### 5.3 Minimal setup in Neon (for testing)

Run in Neon SQL editor (connected to `neondb`, production branch) to ensure demo tenant + admin + sample data exist:

1. Ensure tenant and admin user (example only – adjust if already created):

```sql
INSERT INTO tenants (name, slug)
VALUES ('CDC Demo Tenant', 'cdc-demo')
ON CONFLICT (slug) DO UPDATE
SET name = EXCLUDED.name;

INSERT INTO users (tenant_id, email, password_hash, role, display_name)
VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM tenants WHERE slug = 'cdc-demo'),
  'laiwah76@gmail.com',
  'Hot Dog 1012025§',
  'tenant_admin',
  'CDC Demo Admin'
)
ON CONFLICT (email) DO UPDATE
SET password_hash = EXCLUDED.password_hash,
    role = EXCLUDED.role,
    display_name = EXCLUDED.display_name;
```

2. Attach existing cards to this tenant (so they appear in secure dashboard):

```sql
UPDATE cards
SET tenant_id = (SELECT id FROM tenants WHERE slug = 'cdc-demo')
WHERE tenant_id IS NULL;
```

3. Optional: create a non‑admin user for testing role restrictions:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (tenant_id, email, password_hash, role, display_name)
VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM tenants WHERE slug = 'cdc-demo'),
  'rosetse101@gmail.com',
  'Viewer Pass 123!',
  'tenant_user',
  'CDC Viewer User'
);
```

With this setup:

- `tenant_admin` users (e.g. `laiwah76@gmail.com`) can log in and view secure scans.
- `tenant_user` users (e.g. `rosetse101@gmail.com`) can log in but see an "admin only" message on the secure dashboard.

This extended README is meant to help you (or future you) remember not only the PHP/SQLite side, but also how the Node/Express + Neon + Render secure dashboard is wired: routes, roles, and the minimal SQL needed to bootstrap a demo tenant.
